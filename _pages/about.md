I am an undergraduate student specialized in psychology at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in the computational mechanisms of social cognition and decision-making. Formerly a sociology student, I'm keen on bringing multi-disciplinary insights into the study of human group collaboration, especially collaboration under conflicted interests and hierarchical structures. I'm currently conducting my senior thesis with Dr. Will Cunningham, modeling the emergence of social roles using modified economic games. As a long-time art enthusiast, I've also conducted research in visual aesthetics and categorical decision-making with Dr. Dirk Bernhardt-Walther. As I continue to delve into the intricacies of the human mind, my long-term aim is to help bring unification across various decision-making contexts using an interdisciplinary approach that absorbs insights from distinct fields such as anthropology, cognitive science, economics, and neuroscience.

Outside of research, I'm an avid movie lover. My all-time favorite directors are Wong Kar-wai, Ang Lee, and Quentin Tarantino. I'm also a proud puppy owner of a Bichon Frise named 发财 (which means "prosperity" in Mandarin). I also enjoy video gaming quite a bit :).
