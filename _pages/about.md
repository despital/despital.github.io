I'm an undergraduate at the University of Toronto, specializing in psychology with a keen focus on the computational underpinnings of social cognition and decision-making. My academic roots began in sociology, fueling my passion for interweaving multi-disciplinary perspectives into the study of human group collaboration—particularly when it's mired in conflicting interests and hierarchical structures.

Currently, under the mentorship of Dr. Will Cunningham, I'm crafting my senior thesis on modeling the emergence of social roles using advanced economic game theories. Furthermore, blending my love for art with my academic pursuits, I've dabbled in research on visual aesthetics and categorical decision-making alongside Dr. Dirk Bernhardt-Walther.

With an ever-burning desire to explore the human mind's complexities, my overarching mission is to foster unity across diverse decision-making arenas. This involves harnessing insights from fields as varied as anthropology, cognitive science, economics, and neuroscience.

Away from the rigors of research, cinema captivates me—with Wong Kar-wai, Ang Lee, and Quentin Tarantino ranking as my favorite directors. I cherish moments with my Bichon Frise, 发财 (symbolizing prosperity in Mandarin), and often escape into the world of video games.
